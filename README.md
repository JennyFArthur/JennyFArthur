### **My name is Dr. Jenny Arthur (she/her).**

I am a **glaciologist and remote sensing polar scientist**, focusing on monitoring the Antarctic Ice Sheet. I am involved with several ongoing research projects:

- Investigating subglacial lake activity and hydrology beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet using satellite altimetry.
- Radar survey flight planner for multiple international Antarctic programs as part of the SCAR RINGS initiative (https://scar.org/science/cross/rings).
- Ice-shelf calving front assessement for regional calving flux and ice discharge assessments, small-scale iceberg calving monitoring for operational and scientific purposes. 

I have a PhD in glaciology from Durham University in 2022, where I used satellite remote sensing to investigate supraglacial lakes on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

Within this time, I have worked on cryospheric remote sensing and GIS projects with [Asiaq Greenland Survey](https://www.asiaq-greenlandsurvey.gl/) in Nuuk, Greenland. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a GIS scientist in an international marine consultancy.

*Research interests*: ice-sheet surface and subglacial hydrology, ice-shelf evolution/dynamics and stability, ice shelf-sea ice-mélange interactions, surface climate-firn-mass balance interactions.

*Remote sensing interests*: glacier and ice-shelf structural and calving front change detection (including iceberg calving), satellite imagery classification and analysis methods, remote sensing evaluation of polar regional climate models.
